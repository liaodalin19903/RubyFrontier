#title "Creating a New Source Folder"

You're going to make a Web site. In particular, you're going to make the *source folder* for a Web site; RubyFrontier will generate *(render)* the actual Web site from this. The easiest way to start is to begin with a copy of an existing source folder. RubyFrontier includes one.

Here's what I suggest you do.

1. Create a new folder somewhere. Let's call it `wrapper`.

2. In TextMate, choose RubyFrontier > New Site. You'll be asked, in a dialog, for the location and name of a folder to create. Navigate *inside* `wrapper` and type a name for the source folder. Let's call it `mySourceFolder`. Click "Save."

  <%= caption("newSiteDialog","Dialog for generating a new source folder.") %>

3. The new folder source folder will be created inside `wrapper`...

  <%= caption("sourceFolderCreated","A new source folder, as generated by RubyFrontier.") %>

4. ...and a TextMate project window will open, displaying the source folder.

  <%= caption("sourceFolderProject", "RubyFrontier also creates a TextMate project for managing the source folder.") %>

5. Okay, so far this is great. You've got a new source folder, and you've got a TextMate project for navigating and working with it. But there's just one problem. You need to *save* the TextMate project. And in particular, you really should save it at the top level of `wrapper`. So do that right now! Let's call the project `mySourceFolder` as well (that's its name by default).

  <%= caption("savingSourceFolderProject","Saving the TextMate project.") %>

The resulting hierarchy in `wrapper` should look like this:

<%= caption("wrapperReady","A typical source folder alongside the TextMate project that manages it.") %>

From now on, when you want to work on your Web site, just open this TextMate project and work from there.
