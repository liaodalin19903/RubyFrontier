#title "Bundle Commands"

The following commands are presently available in the TextMate RubyFrontier bundle. To access them, choose Bundles > RubyFrontier or use the little popup menu at the bottom of the TextMate document window.

* **Preflight Site**. Calls `UserLand::Html::preflightSite()`. Generates a new [autoglossary](autoglossary) for the entire site of the selected page object. Works best if you manually delete the existing `#autoglossary.yaml` file first. Causes all local links to work properly (if they are going to work properly). For example, if you move a site folder to a different location, this is the first thing you should do. Any output will consist of error messages reporting duplicate names (e.g. two different files named `mypage.txt` or titled `"My Cool Page"`); duplicate names aren't fatal but you'll probably be happier if you fix them anyway.

* **Check NextPrevs**. Ignore this.

* **New Site**. Calls `UserLand::Html::newSite()`. This is how you [make a new site](start).

* **Publish Page**. Calls `UserLand::Html::releaseRenderedPage()`. This is how you [publish a single page](howsapage) (the current page in TextMate). Errors are reported in the output. Not every error is fatal (i.e. some errors permit the page to be published anyway) and not every error needs fixing (e.g. failure to find a [snippet](snippets) could be deliberate, because you really did mean to surround some text with two pairs of square brackets). But an error reported by [RefGlossary](autoglossary), for example, does need fixing (because a link is not getting formed properly), and of course an error that prevents the page from being published needs fixing too.

* **Publish Site**. Calls `UserLand::Html::publishSite()`. This is how you [publish the whole site](howsapage) containing the current page in TextMate. Basically, this is the same as **Preflight Site** followed by **Publish Page** for every page object. This is the *only* way to publish [non-renderables](types). This can take quite a long time, and while it is churning away there is no output, so please be patient; sorry about that. (I've done what I can to speed things up.) The output reports the publishing of each page object. Unfortunately, if there are any error messages, they are mingled in with the publishing reports, so always glance over the entire output looking for errors. Even if a fatal error occurs, the error message might not be at the start or end of the output page; you really do have to look over the entire thing. Some day I'll probably improve this feedback.

* **Traverse Selected Link**. Calls `UserLand::Html::traverseLink()`. This is a writing tool. When you realize that it's there and you understand what it does, you're going to be really, really grateful I put it in. It's very simple. In a page object, you select the entire contents of an `href` attribute; when you choose this menu item, RubyFrontier tries to [interpret](autoglossary) this `href` value just as it would do if it were publishing the page, and, if it succeeds, it opens that page object in TextMate. Believe me, when you've got a site of 200 pages and want to know what's in the page targeted by `[some text](somelink)`, this is a real time-saver; you just select "somelink" and issue this command.
