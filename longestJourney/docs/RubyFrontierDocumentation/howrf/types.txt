## The Types of Thing in a RubyFrontier Source Folder

RubyFrontier expects to encounter certain items in certain places within a source folder. Here's a typical example source folder and a quick overview of the rules concerning what's inside it:

<%= imageref("structure") %>

Everything in a RubyFrontier source folder is one of the following:

* A **directive**. A directive is a file or folder whose name begins with `#` (number-sign). Directives are used to instruct RubyFrontier about certain settings, and are also just a convenient way for the source folder to contain files and folders that are not copied into the Web site.

* A **page object**. A page object is a file that is not a directive and is not inside a directive folder. RubyFrontier will turn every page object into a file in the Web site. There are two main ways this can happen:

  * If a page object has extension `.txt`, `.opml`, or `.rb`, it is considered a **renderable**. This means that RubyFrontier will process the file in some way, and the corresponding file that will be created in the Web site will be the result of that processing.

  * Otherwise, a page object will simply be copied directly from the source folder into the Web site, unaltered. (For example, you might like to include a .pdf file for reading, or a .zip file for download, within your Web site. Traditionally, a non-renderable is called a **binary**.)

* A normal **folder**. A normal folder is a folder which is not, and is not inside, a directive folder. If a folder contains any page objects, a folder by the same name and in the same relative position will be created in the Web site.

When RubyFrontier creates the Web site from the source folder, the hierarchical structure of the Web site will be essentially the same as that of the folders and page objects in the source folder. So, in the above screen shot, start at the top: The Web site will contain a Web page rendered from the file `scriptde.txt`, and it will also contain a folder called `scriptdefolder`, inside which will be a Web page rendered from the file `develop.txt`, and so on.
