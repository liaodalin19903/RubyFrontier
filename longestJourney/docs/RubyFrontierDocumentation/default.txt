## What Is RubyFrontier?

It's a way of maintaining and generating Web sites. 

It imitates [UserLand Frontier](Frontier), but it's written in [Ruby](Ruby).

It presently uses [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) (a superb writing / programming tool, and very nimble when dealing with a big hierarchy of files). In a sense that means RubyFrontier is Mac-only, though there isn't any *a priori* reason for this (since Ruby is platform-agnostic).

You might like to watch this [screencast](http://www.apeth.com/whatisrubyfrontier.mov) showing RubyFrontier in action.

More description of what RubyFrontier is [here](what).

## Why RubyFrontier?

## How Do I Use RubyFrontier?

Ah. I thought you'd never ask. Let's [get started](start).
