Script Debugger gives you powerful, unique tools to help you develop your AppleScript code. From a short one-off script to a complicated program, you'll easily and quickly create code that works.

You can think of the AppleScript development cycle in three stages:

<dl>
<dt>[Edit](Edit) your code.
</dt>
<dd>[Enter](Inserting Content) code, [view](View) it, [navigate](Navigate) it, [search](Find) it, [modify](Comment) it.
</dd>

<dt>[Run](Run) your code.
</dt>
<dd>[Compile](Compile) code, [execute](Execute) it, [time](Times) it, get the [result](Result), and [log](Apple Event Log) Apple event communication between your code and scriptable applications.
</dd>

<dt>[Debug](Debug) your code.
</dt>
<dd>[Step](Step) through code, set [breakpoints](Breakpoints), watch [values](Variables (Debug Mode)) change as your code progresses. Understand what your code does, line by line!
</dd>
