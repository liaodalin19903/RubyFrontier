#title "My Second Web Page"
#markdown 1
#template "secondtemplate"
#linkstylesheets ["s1"]

# <%= title %>

This page illustrates use of Markdown. I don't recommend using Markdown any longer because:

* it is somewhat indeterminate in its behavior

* it is no longer actively supported

* it has many quirks that need to be worked around

I now use kramdown instead; look at the [third page](thirdpage) for an example. Oooh, did you notice how easy it was for me to make a link?

This page also illustrates use of a named template. You can tell because the template colors the background.

Plus, it illustrates use of CSS. You can tell because the stylesheet colors the text.
