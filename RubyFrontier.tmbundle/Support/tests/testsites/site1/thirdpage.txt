#title "My Third and Greatest Web Page"

# <%= title %>

Okay, now things are really getting insanely cool:

* Instead of Markdown, as on the [second page](secondpage), *this* page is using [kramdown](kramdown).

* We're using an explicitly specified template, and that template is constructed using [Haml](haml).

* We're also specifying a stylesheet (you can tell because the text is red and the background is white), and that stylesheet is written using [SASS](sass). Plus, the stylesheet is embedded, just to demonstrate how that's done.

I formed those external links easily using the Glossary feature.

<%= section "About This Page" %>

Now I'd like to demonstrate snippets: [[blurb]]

Also, I'd like to demonstrate one way to embed explicit HTML written as HAML:

<%%%
%table(border="1")
  %tr
    %td Is this cool?
    %td Yes, it is!
%%%>

(Of course, that table was so simple we could have done the same thing with kramdown alone:)

|Is this cool?|Yes, it is!|
{:border="1"}
